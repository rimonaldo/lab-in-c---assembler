errors are handled through implicit testing embedded within the programâ€™s logic, rather than through predefined test cases.

the main program file will pass a StatusInfo struct through each major stage
e.g:
00_preprocessor(StatusInfo) -> 01_first pass(StatusInfo) -> 02_second pass(StatusInfo)


if a test is failed, a request to write_error_log is called
write_error_log is recieving error code parameter, and is fetching full ErrorInfo out of errors and warnings bank

StatusInfo have error_count and warning_count fields,incremented for each error or warning written in log
the program will not continue to next stage if the error count is over 0
but it will continue to next stage if all of the items in error log are warnings
