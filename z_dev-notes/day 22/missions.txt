error *stam shura* 
    bad syntax just get skipped. need to write error for undefined line ✅

mat parsing 
    fix directive .mat parsing 
    (since we ignore [] as delimeter in tokenizer) ✅ (very ugly code but it works for now )

corrected entry symbols handling
    fix declaring .entry inline of symbol declaration
    (should have type code or data depend on next line)

    
symbol table item data type + memory seperation of data image and code image
    * create incrementing logic plan 
    * symbol_table data as SymbolInfo => is not | saved or loaded | properly
    so maybe i need an insert function that will insert SymbolInfo
    

2nd pass - encode direct addressed operands
    traverse syntax tree nodes from head 
    if it is instruction, check if any operand is direct mode
    if an operand has direct addressing mode, look for it in symbol symbol_table
    encode most significant 8 bits to address, 2 least sig bits to AER (so i need is_entry is_extern info on table)

2nd pass - write .ent and .ext files
