corrected mat parsing 
    * its not done because 
    directive .mat is broken now (since we ignore [] as delimeter in tokenizer)

corrected entry symbols handling
    * its not done because
    declaring .entry inline of symbol declaration is broken 
    (should have type code or data depend on next line)

    
memory seperation of data image and code image
    IC init 100
    DC init 0

    run_first_pass
    save ICF

    for each symbol()=> type.data.type == data ? ++ICF : continue

    * missing incrementing logic plan 
    * symbol_table data as SymbolInfo => is not | saved or loaded | properly
