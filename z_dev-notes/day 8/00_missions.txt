- finish encoding
    - include binary machine code for what ever is possible during first pass


encoding table:
label  |  decimal address  |  base4 address  |   inst   |  ops  |  bin code
            start 100


symbol table:
label  |  decimal address  |  statement type




mov  M1[r2][r7],LENGTH => 0000-10-01-00


----------- instructions encoding ----------- 
  
0,1 => A(absolute),E(external),R(relocatable) => A=00, E=01, R=10
** only for encoded instructions, and their added words **
** not for directives and data **

2,3 => addressing mode of src op

4,5 => addressing mode of dest op

6,7,8,9 => opcode (0-15) => [0000 , 1111]


----------- operands encoding ----------- 

immediate => #int
            8 bits for the value itself 
            0,1 is AER

direct => adress of label
            8 bits for the value itself
            0,1 is AER

mat access => label + 2 registers = 2 added words
            1. the adress of mat label
            2. the indecies: 6-9 row reg, 2-5 col reg , 
            0,1 is AER
    

register => if reg is -only- src op     -> 2-5 reg num
            if reg is -only- dest op    -> 6,9 reg num
            if reg is -both- src & dest -> 2-5 src reg, 6-9 dest reg
            0,1 is AER



→ **Directives:**

A directive statement is a statement that instructs the **assembler**
what to do **during the assembly process**, not during program execution.

A directive can tell the assembler to:
- allocate memory,
- initialize or store data,
- declare symbols or labels,
- or mark external or entry points.

Unlike instructions, **directives do not produce machine code**
and are not executed at runtime.  
Instead, they help organize the program and guide the assembler 
in generating the final output.



    .data
gets integers as parameters
directs the assembler to allocate memory space in the data image
that will store parameter values, and increment the DC 
accordingly to num of params.
** if a label is declared ** in this statement line, 
than the label will get the IC value (before DC incrementation)
and will be stored in symbol table. (this will point to the first value)


    .string
gets valid "string", string chars will be encoded by ascii values
+ null termination char at the end (0)
** if a label is declared ** it will point to the first char
(it will be written in symbol table, with IC of first char)


    .mat
can be un-initialized or initialized
it is legal to not declare a label, but than you can not use it as operand


    .entry
gets label name that is *defined in current file*
this is flagging the symbol so it could be used in other src files
**note** if label is declared in .entry line, it will be ignored 
example:
    ENTRY: .entry HELLO => ⚠️ warning, label declaration ignored 
    (HELLO will still be flagged as an entry point)


    .extern
gets label that is *not defined in current file*
it is used to tell the assembler that this label is defined in other file,
and flagged as entry point there, so current file can use the label.
// the matching process is done by the linker
**note** if label is declared in .extern line, it will be ignored 
example:
    EXTERN: .extern HELLO => ⚠️ warning, label declaration ignored 
    (HELLO will still be declared as an external label)
**note**
it's not allowed to define in the same file same label as .entry and .extern.
example:
    .entry HELLO
    .extern HELLO => ❌ error
